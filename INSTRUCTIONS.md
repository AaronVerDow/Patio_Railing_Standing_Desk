This is designed to be used without any fasteners or glue holding the parts together.  This makes it easier to take down and store.  The parameters will most likely need to be tweaked for your individual railing.

* Download the scad files and keep them in the same directory.  
* Open standing_porch_desk.scad and optionally cutsheet.scad in OpenSCAD
* Play with the numbers to create the desk you want
* Once complete render the cutsheet.scad by opening it in OpenSCAD and pressing F6
* File -> Export DXF or SVG
